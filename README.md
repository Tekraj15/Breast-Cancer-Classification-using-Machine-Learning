# Breast-Cancer-Classification-using-Machine-Learning
# To build a breast cancer classifier on an IDC dataset that can accurately classify a histology image as benign or malignant.
we’ll build a classifier to train on 80% of a breast cancer histology image dataset. Of this, we’ll keep 10% of the data for validation. Using Keras, we’ll define a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network), call it CancerNet, and train it on our images. We’ll then derive a confusion matrix to analyze the performance of the model.

IDC is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma; cancer that develops in a milk duct and invades the fibrous or fatty breast tissue outside the duct; it is the most common form of breast cancer forming 80% of all breast cancer diagnoses. And histology is the study of the microscopic structure of tissues.
